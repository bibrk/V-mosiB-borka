	<p> I used to going to the gym three or four times a weak. I usually work out with weights, and unfortunately i only have one dumbbell at home. I really hate doing bodyweight exercises, so it was hard for me to not to stop working out regularly (i even stopped working out for a month). A few days ago i decided to start exercising again, because i really enjoy it, and i miss going to the gym so much. I want to work out at least four times a weak, I need to get in shape again.</p> 
	<p> <b> I link some useful videos for working out at home: </b> </p>
